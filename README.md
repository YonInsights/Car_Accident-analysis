#Road Accident Analysis Dashboard
##Project Description:
In this project, I designed and developed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze road accident data for 2021 and 2022. The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total casualties, accident severity, vehicle type involvement, and more, using dynamic filters and slicers to explore insights at different granularities.
##Project Process:
Data Collection: Sourced from Kaggle; 307k rows of road accident data.
Data Cleaning: Adjusted column widths, added filters, checked for blanks, duplicates, and typos.
Data Processing: Created custom columns and applied Excel formulas for further analysis.
Data Analysis: Built pivot tables, aggregated data, and developed charts for analysis.
Data Visualization: Designed custom charts, formatted visualizations, and arranged the final dashboard layout.
Dynamic Dashboard: Integrated filters for date, accident location (rural/urban), and accident type.
##Tools Used:
Excel: Data cleaning, processing, pivot tables, slicers, and dashboard creation.
